Questions 
   1.  How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
   2.  How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

Creating "User-Stories" helps immensely with this because it gives an idea of how I should start, and what goals I need to keep in mind. For example, if the user wanted to be able to access content through a side navigation bar, then I would design the project according to that in mind.
