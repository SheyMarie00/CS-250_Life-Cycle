Answers:
1. I can interpret user needs and implement them into a program by first figuring out what the Tester has written down for user requests. This information originates from the Product Owner. From there, I can look at the basis of what the user needs, and spin my idea of it. And then pass it through the Product Owner to see if it works well. Once approved then I can finalize everything else, and begin working on the next task. Creating "User-Stories" helps a lot with this because it gives an idea of how I should start, and what goals I need to keep in mind. For example, if the user wanted to be able to access content through a side navigation bar, then I would design the project according to that in mind. 
2. When approaching developing programs, it's a good idea to approach them with an open,flexible, and organized mind. As developers, we cannot approach the program head on. There is a lot of planning that goes into a project before it becomes the final project. Whilst creating the program, the most important agile process I hope to incorporate is organization and communication. 
3. To be a good team member in software development, it means that the team member remains on top of tasks. If they have any concerns, they need to feel free to voice their opinions. A good team member also has to remain flexible and open minded. If a team member is soley stuck on what they think is right or doesn't really accept changes well, then it hinders the entire team. Because, everyone in the team is important, there shouldn't be any doubt that what you do goes overlooked or is unappreciated. Good team members must stick together.
